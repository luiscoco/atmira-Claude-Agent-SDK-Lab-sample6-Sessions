# Claude Agent SDK Lab (TypeScript + React 19.3)

A small learning app that introduces the features of the **Claude Agent SDK**
(`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, formerly "Claude Code SDK") one concept at a time.
Each concept has its own tab in the UI, its own server route, and is small enough to read in a few minutes.

| Concept | Topic | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `query()` and the message stream | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Options: `model`, `systemPrompt`, `maxTurns`, `maxBudgetUsd`, `includePartialMessages` | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Built-in tools: `tools`, `allowedTools`, `permissionMode`, `cwd` | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Permissions: `canUseTool`, where you approve or deny each tool call from the UI | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Custom tools: `createSdkMcpServer` + `tool()` with zod | ✅ Done |
| 6 | [Sessions: multi-turn chat with `resume`](Tab6-Sessions.md) | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Hooks: `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` | ⏳ |
| 8 | Subagents: `agents` | ⏳ |
| 9 | Structured output (`outputFormat`) and interrupting a run | ⏳ |

## Quick start

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**.

`npm run dev` uses `concurrently` to start two processes:

| Process | Command | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `server` | `node --watch --env-file-if-exists=.env --import tsx server/index.ts` (Express + Agent SDK) | 3001 |
| `web` | `vite` (React UI, forwards `/api` to 3001) | 5173 |

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (built with Node 24.21 and npm 11.19)
- **Authentication**, using either of these:
  - an existing Claude Code login (`claude` CLI already signed in). The SDK reuses it, which is how this project was tested, **or**
  - the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

---

## Running the app from Windows Terminal

These commands work in **PowerShell**, which is the default profile in Windows Terminal.
Where **Command Prompt (cmd)** needs different syntax, both versions are shown.

### 1. Go to the project folder

The path contains spaces, so it must be in quotes:

```powershell
cd "C:\Curso atmira - Los seis pilares del IA Spec-Driven Development (SDD)\Claude Code SDK samples\sample1"
```

### 2. Check the prerequisites (first time only)

```powershell
node -v          # must be v18 or newer
npm -v
claude --version # optional: shows whether the Claude Code CLI is installed
```

### 3. Install dependencies (first time only, or after pulling changes)

```powershell
npm install
npm install-scripts approve esbuild   # npm 11+ only: allow esbuild's install script
npm rebuild esbuild
```

### 4. Authenticate (first time only)

**Option A: Claude Code login** (recommended; this is how the project was tested)

```powershell
claude   # log in when asked, then type /exit
```

**Option B: API key in a `.env` file** (set up in this project)

1. Copy the template and put your key in it:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   notepad .env          # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```
2. Run `npm run dev` as usual. The `dev:server` script loads the file with Node's built-in flag:
   ```json
   "dev:server": "node --watch --env-file-if-exists=.env --import tsx server/index.ts"
   ```
   `--env-file-if-exists` means the server still starts if `.env` is missing; it then uses the Claude Code login instead.
3. When the server starts, it shows which authentication it is using (the key is masked):
   ```
   Auth: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from .env (sk-ant-api…abcd)
   ```

No SDK code is needed. `query()` passes `process.env` to the Claude Code process it starts,
and that process reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from it.
`.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so the key is never committed. Only `.env.example` (with an empty value) is committed.

**Check which credential was used:** expand the `system / init` message in the UI and look at `apiKeySource`:

| `apiKeySource` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"` | The key from `.env` (or from the environment) |
| `"none"` | No API key: the claude.ai login (OAuth) is being used |

> **Notes**
> - An API key is billed through the **Anthropic Console** (pay per use, separate from a Claude subscription).
>   If the account has no credits, every request fails with `billing_error` / *"Credit balance is too low"*.
>   Add credits at console.anthropic.com → Billing, or comment out the line in `.env` to go back to the Claude Code login.
> - If you start the server from **inside a Claude Code session** (for example Claude Code's own terminal tool),
>   the agent inherits that session's login and ignores the key. `apiKeySource` then shows `"none"`.
>   A normal Windows Terminal tab doesn't have this problem.

**Option C: API key as a terminal variable** (instead of `.env`)

```powershell
# PowerShell: current terminal session only
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."

# PowerShell: permanent for your user (open a NEW terminal afterwards)
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "sk-ant-..."
```

```cmd
:: Command Prompt: current terminal session only
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### 5. Start the app

**Option A: one terminal (server and web together)**

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Output from both processes appears in the same terminal, labelled `[server]` (blue) and `[web]` (green).
Open **http://localhost:5173**, or start it from the terminal:

```powershell
start http://localhost:5173
```

**Option B: two terminal tabs** (the output of each process is easier to read)

Open a second tab in Windows Terminal with `Ctrl+Shift+T`, `cd` to the project folder in both tabs, then run:

```powershell
# Tab 1: Node server with the Agent SDK (port 3001)
npm run dev:server
```

```powershell
# Tab 2: React UI (port 5173)
npm run dev:web
```

Both options reload automatically: `node --watch` restarts the server and Vite refreshes the browser whenever you save a file.

### 6. Stop the app

Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal where the app is running. If a port stays busy (`EADDRINUSE`), find and stop the process that is using it:

```powershell
# Which process is using port 3001 (or 5173)?
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3001 -State Listen | Select-Object OwningProcess

# Stop it
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3001 -State Listen | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }
```

```cmd
:: Command Prompt: find the PID, then stop it
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <pid> /F
```

### 7. Optional: test the server without the UI

Start only the server (`npm run dev:server`), then run this in another tab.
Use `curl.exe` rather than `curl`, because in Windows PowerShell 5.1 `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`.
Putting the JSON body in a file avoids quoting problems in PowerShell:

```powershell
'{"prompt":"Say hello in 5 words."}' | Set-Content body.json
curl.exe -N -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/c1/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "@body.json"
Remove-Item body.json
```

The `event: message` lines should appear in this order: `system/init` → `assistant` → `result`, followed by `event: done`.

### 8. Optional: type-check the whole project

```powershell
npx tsc -p .
```

No output means no errors.

## Architecture: why is there a server?

The Agent SDK **does not run in the browser**. `query()` starts a Claude Code agent
process that can read files, run shell commands and call tools, so it has to run in Node.js.
The React app sends a request to a small Express server, and the server streams each SDK message back:

```
React 19.3 (src/)  ──POST /api/c1/query──▶  Express (server/)  ──query()──▶  Claude Code agent
      ▲                                              │
      └──────── Server-Sent Events: one event per SDKMessage ◀┘
```

- **Server → browser** uses Server-Sent Events (SSE). The request is a POST, and the browser's
  `EventSource` only supports GET, so the client reads and parses the response stream itself
  (see [src/lib/sse.ts](src/lib/sse.ts)).
- **Cancellation:** when the browser disconnects, the server calls `abort()` on an `AbortController`.
  That controller is passed to the SDK's `abortController` option, so the agent run stops too.

## Steps followed

### Step 0: Check the environment

Checked the tool versions and the latest package versions before writing any code:

```bash
node -v                                        # v24.21.0
npm -v                                         # 11.19.0
npm view react version                         # 19.3.0
npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk version  # 0.3.281
npm view vite version                          # 8.3.0
```

### Step 1: Create the project and install dependencies

1. Created `package.json` with `"type": "module"` and the `dev` scripts.
2. Installed the runtime dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i react@19.3.0 react-dom@19.3.0 @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk express zod
   ```
3. Installed the development dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react typescript tsx concurrently \
            @types/react @types/react-dom @types/express @types/node
   ```
4. **npm 11 blocks install scripts by default.** Vite and tsx depend on `esbuild`, which needs its
   postinstall script to run, so it had to be approved explicitly:
   ```bash
   npm install-scripts approve esbuild
   npm rebuild esbuild
   ```

### Step 2: Read the SDK's type definitions

The SDK changes quickly, so the code was written against the installed version's
`node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk.d.ts` rather than from memory. Key findings:

- `query({ prompt: string | AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>, options?: Options }): Query`
- `SDKMessage` is a union of many message types. The three main ones are
  `SDKSystemMessage` (`system/init`), `SDKAssistantMessage` and `SDKResultMessage`.
- `Options.tools`: `[]` turns off every built-in tool, and `{ type: 'preset', preset: 'claude_code' }` enables all of them.
- The package also includes a `browser-sdk` entry point, but it connects to a *remote* Claude Code
  over WebSocket. It doesn't replace running the SDK in Node, so this project doesn't use it.

### Step 3: Build the server and the React skeleton

- [server/sse.ts](server/sse.ts): a reusable helper that every concept will use.
- [server/index.ts](server/index.ts): the Express app, which mounts one router per concept.
- [src/lib/sse.ts](src/lib/sse.ts), [src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx) and
  [src/components/MessageLog.tsx](src/components/MessageLog.tsx): the UI shell and the raw message viewer.
- [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts): sets up the `/api` proxy, so the browser only ever talks to `localhost:5173`.

### Step 4: Concept 1, `query()` and the message stream

**Server:** [server/concepts/01-query.ts](server/concepts/01-query.ts)

```ts
const run = query({
  prompt,
  options: {
    abortController: abort, // stop the agent if the browser disconnects
    tools: [],              // no built-in tools yet: pure Q&A
    maxTurns: 1,
  },
});
pipe(run); // for await (const msg of run) -> send as an SSE event
```

**Client:** [src/concepts/Concept01Query.tsx](src/concepts/Concept01Query.tsx) collects every message and
builds three summary cards from them:

| Message | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `system` / `init` | `session_id`, `model`, `tools`, `cwd`, `mcp_servers`, `permissionMode` |
| `assistant` | `message.content[]`: content blocks (`text` for now; later `tool_use`, `thinking`) |
| `result` / `success` | `result` (final text), `total_cost_usd`, `usage`, `duration_ms`, `num_turns` |

What to take away:

1. `query()` doesn't return a single string. It returns an **async iterable** of messages,
   so the app can show each step of the agent as it happens.
2. The `result` message is always the last one, and it holds the cost and usage data.
3. `options` controls everything else: tools, model, limits, and in later concepts permissions, hooks and sessions.

### Step 5: Check that it works

1. **Type-check:** `npx tsc -p .` must exit with 0. The first run failed on the `import "./styles.css"`
   line. Adding `"vite/client"` to `compilerOptions.types` in `tsconfig.json` fixed it.
2. **Endpoint test without the UI:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx server/index.ts
   curl -N -X POST localhost:3001/api/c1/query \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"prompt":"Say hello in 5 words."}'
   ```
   It returned `system/init` → `assistant` → `result` → `done`. Authentication came from the existing Claude Code login.

---

## Things to try in Concept 1

1. Run the default prompt and expand each entry in **Raw SDK message stream** to see its full JSON.
2. Look at `tools` in `system/init`. It's empty because of `tools: []`.
3. Compare `total_cost_usd` and the token counts across different prompts.
4. Ask for something that needs several steps. `maxTurns: 1` stops the agent after one turn.

---

## Step 6: Concept 2, Options

> A detailed, step-by-step account of how this concept was built is in [Tab2-Options.md](Tab2-Options.md).

**Server:** [server/concepts/02-options.ts](server/concepts/02-options.ts)

The route builds `options` from the form. It only sets the options you chose, so leaving a field empty
really means "use the SDK default". Before calling `query()` it sends the options back as an
`options` SSE event, so the UI shows exactly what the SDK received:

```ts
const options: Options = { tools: [], includePartialMessages };
if (model) options.model = model;
if (mode === "custom") options.systemPrompt = systemPrompt;             // replaces the system prompt
if (mode === "preset") options.systemPrompt = { type: "preset", preset: "claude_code", append };
if (maxTurns) options.maxTurns = maxTurns;
if (maxBudgetUsd) options.maxBudgetUsd = maxBudgetUsd;

send("options", options);
pipe(query({ prompt, options: { ...options, abortController: abort } }));
```

**Client:** [src/concepts/Concept02Options.tsx](src/concepts/Concept02Options.tsx)

| Option | What it does | Where you see it |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | Which Claude model runs the agent. Omit it to use the CLI default | `system/init` → `model` |
| `systemPrompt` (string) | **Replaces** the system prompt completely | The tone of the answer (try the pirate example) |
| `systemPrompt` (`preset: "claude_code"` + `append`) | Keeps Claude Code's full system prompt and adds your text at the end | The answer says it is Claude Code, and follows your appended rule |
| `maxTurns` | Stops after N turns with `result/error_max_turns` | `result.num_turns` |
| `maxBudgetUsd` | Stops once the cost goes over N dollars with `result/error_max_budget_usd` | The yellow result card |
| `includePartialMessages` | Also emits `{ type: "stream_event" }` messages, one per Messages API streaming event | The answer appears token by token |

What to take away:

1. **Omitted is not the same as empty.** With no `systemPrompt`, the SDK uses its own minimal default.
   A string replaces it. The `claude_code` preset gives you the full Claude Code prompt, which is much longer
   (compare `usage.input_tokens` and `total_cost_usd` between the modes).
2. **Limits end the run in two ways at once.** When `maxBudgetUsd` or `maxTurns` is reached, the SDK first emits a
   `result` message with an `error_*` subtype and then the `for await` loop **throws**
   (`Claude Code returned an error result: Reached maximum budget ($0.0001)`). Real code should read the
   `result` message and also catch the error. The UI shows both.
3. **Budget is checked after a model call, not before.** With `maxBudgetUsd: 0.0001` the first call still runs
   (≈ $0.001 on Haiku), and then the run stops. It is a safety net, not an exact cap.
4. **Partial messages are extra, not a replacement.** With `includePartialMessages`, text arrives as
   `stream_event` → `event.type: "content_block_delta"` → `delta.text`. The complete `assistant` message
   still arrives at the end. A short answer can produce a dozen `stream_event` messages, so the raw log hides them by default.

### Check that it works

`npx tsc -p .` exits with 0, and these requests were tested against the running server:

| Request | Result |
|---|---|
| Haiku + custom pirate prompt + partial messages | `init.model` = `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, 13 `stream_event` messages, *"Ahoy, ye scurvy dogs, welcome aboard!"* |
| Haiku + `maxBudgetUsd: 0.0001` | `result/error_max_budget_usd` (cost $0.00095), then an `error` event |
| Haiku + preset `claude_code` + append "End every answer with ARRR" | *"I'm Claude Code, … ARRR"* |

```powershell
'{"prompt":"Say hello in 5 words.","model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","systemPromptMode":"custom","systemPrompt":"You are a pirate.","includePartialMessages":true}' | Set-Content body.json
curl.exe -N -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/c2/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "@body.json"
Remove-Item body.json
```

## Things to try in Concept 2

1. Run the same prompt with each model and compare `duration_ms` and `total_cost_usd`.
2. Switch `systemPrompt` between the three modes and compare `input_tokens`.
3. Set `maxBudgetUsd` to `0.0001` and watch the yellow cards.
4. Turn `includePartialMessages` off and on with a long prompt ("Write a 300-word story"), then untick
   "Hide stream_event messages" to see the raw deltas.
5. `maxTurns` has no visible effect yet: with `tools: []` the agent always finishes in one turn.
   You'll see `error_max_turns` in Concept 3, when the agent can call tools and loop.

---

## Step 7: Concept 3, Built-in tools

> A detailed, step-by-step account of how this concept was built is in [Tab3-Built-in-tools.md](Tab3-Built-in-tools.md).

**Server:** [server/concepts/03-tools.ts](server/concepts/03-tools.ts)

The agent works in a `sandbox/` folder that the server seeds with `notes.txt` and `data/tasks.json`.
`GET /api/c3/files` lists it and `POST /api/c3/reset` restores it, so you can see what each run changed:

```ts
const options: Options = {
  tools,                 // string[] or { type: "preset", preset: "claude_code" }
  allowedTools,          // tool names or rules like "Bash(ls:*)": run without a permission check
  cwd: SANDBOX,          // chosen from a fixed list; the browser never sends a path
  settingSources: [],    // don't inherit ~/.claude settings (allow rules, plugins)
  strictMcpConfig: true, // don't inherit MCP servers
};
if (permissionMode) options.permissionMode = permissionMode;
if (permissionMode === "bypassPermissions") options.allowDangerouslySkipPermissions = true;
```

**Client:** [src/concepts/Concept03Tools.tsx](src/concepts/Concept03Tools.tsx)

| Option | What it does | Where you see it |
|---|---|---|
| `tools` | Which built-in tools **exist** for the model | `system/init` → `tools` |
| `allowedTools` | Which calls run **without asking**. It doesn't add or remove tools | The call succeeds instead of being denied |
| `permissionMode` | Policy for calls that aren't pre-allowed: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions` | `system/init` → `permissionMode`, yellow `tool_result` |
| `cwd` | The folder the agent starts in | `system/init` → `cwd`, the `sandbox/ on disk` card |

The tab pairs each `tool_use` block (in an `assistant` message) with its `tool_result` block (in the next `user` message).
Seven scenario buttons change one option at a time: read-only, Write denied, Write + `allowedTools`,
`acceptEdits`, `plan`, a `Bash(ls:*)` rule with `dontAsk`, and `maxTurns: 2`.

What to take away:

1. **With no `canUseTool`, "ask" means "deny".** In `default` mode, `Write` is refused. The run still ends in
   `result/success`, and the refusal is listed in `result.permission_denials`.
2. **A denied model tries something else.** Before isolation was added, the agent wrote the "denied" file to another
   folder that the machine's user settings allowed. Always set `settingSources` and `strictMcpConfig` on purpose.
3. **Tools make `maxTurns` matter.** Each tool call costs a turn, so `maxTurns: 2` now ends with `error_max_turns`.

### Check that it works

`npx tsc -p .` exits with 0, and all seven scenarios were run against the server:

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Read-only (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`) | Ran without asking, `success` |
| `Write`, `default` mode | `permission_denials: [Write]`, no file |
| `Write` in `allowedTools`, or `acceptEdits` | `sandbox/summary.md` created |
| `plan` | `sandbox/` unchanged, plan written to `~/.claude/plans/` |
| `Bash(ls:*)` + `dontAsk` | `ls -la` ran, `touch hello.txt` denied |
| `maxTurns: 2` | `error_max_turns`, then an `error` event |

## Things to try in Concept 3

1. Run scenarios 2, 3 and 4 in order and watch the `sandbox/ on disk` card. Press **Reset sandbox/** in between.
2. Switch `tools` to the `claude_code` preset and count the tools in `system/init`.
3. In scenario 6, change the rule to `Bash(touch:*)` and see which command is denied now.
4. Set `cwd` to **project root** and ask "How many concepts does App.tsx register?" using only `Read` and `Grep`.
5. Remove `settingSources: []` from the server and run scenario 2 again. Compare the result and `total_cost_usd`.

---

## Step 8: Concept 4, Permissions with `canUseTool`

> A detailed, step-by-step account of how this concept was built is in [Tab4-Permissions.md](Tab4-Permissions.md).

**Server:** [server/concepts/04-permissions.ts](server/concepts/04-permissions.ts)

In Concept 3, a call that needed permission was denied because nobody was there to ask. `canUseTool` is an async
function that the SDK **awaits** before such a call runs. The server parks each request in a `Map`, streams it to the
browser as a `permission_request` SSE event, and resolves the promise when the browser POSTs to `/api/c4/decide`:

```ts
const askTheUser: CanUseTool = (toolName, input, opts) =>
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    const id = randomUUID();
    pending.set(id, { input, suggestions: opts.suggestions, resolve });
    send("permission_request", { id, toolName, input, ... });
  });

// POST /api/c4/decide  { id, choice, updatedInput?, message? }
{ behavior: "allow", updatedInput }                       // Allow (optionally with an edited input)
{ behavior: "allow", updatedInput, updatedPermissions }   // Allow always (the SDK's suggestions, forced to "session")
{ behavior: "deny", message }                             // Deny: the model reads the message
{ behavior: "deny", message, interrupt: true }            // Deny + interrupt: the whole run stops
```

**Client:** [src/concepts/Concept04Permissions.tsx](src/concepts/Concept04Permissions.tsx)

Each pending call is shown as an approval card with an editable `input` JSON, a deny message and four buttons.
Seven scenario buttons: approve a write, deny with a message, edit the input, always allow, Bash + interrupt,
a policy written in code (no human), and `allowedTools` skipping the callback.

What to take away:

1. **`canUseTool` is only asked about calls that would "ask".** Read-only tools, `allowedTools` entries and the
   `permissionMode` decide first.
2. **A deny `message` is feedback, not just a refusal.** The model reads it and adapts (e.g. writes `SUMMARY.txt` instead).
3. **`updatedInput` changes what really runs, and the model is not told.** It may still claim it wrote `hello.txt`.
4. **`interrupt: true` ends the run** with `result/error_during_execution`, followed by an `error` event.
5. **Check where `updatedPermissions` would be saved.** For Bash, the SDK suggests `localSettings`, a file on disk.
   The server forces `destination: "session"`.

### Check that it works

`npx tsc -p .` exits with 0, and all seven scenarios were run against the server, answered by a script:

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Approve a write | `Read` not asked, `Write` asked once, `summary.md` created |
| Deny with a message | The model retried as `SUMMARY.txt`. `permission_denials: [Write]` |
| Edit the input | `edited.txt` created instead of `hello.txt`. The answer still says `hello.txt` |
| Always allow | Asked once (suggestion: `setMode acceptEdits`), then `b.txt` and `c.txt` were written without asking |
| Bash + interrupt | `ls` not asked, `touch` allowed, `rm` denied + interrupt → `error_during_execution` |
| Policy in code | `ok.txt` allowed, `../outside.txt` and `rm notes.txt` denied |
| `allowedTools` wins | The callback was never called |

## Things to try in Concept 4

1. In scenario 2, deny twice with different messages and see how the model reacts.
2. In scenario 3, change only `content`. Then read the answer: does the model know?
3. In scenario 4, press plain **Allow** instead and count the approval cards.
4. Leave an approval card open and close the browser tab. The server's `signal` handler denies the call.
5. Change `permissionMode` to `acceptEdits` in scenario 1. Does the approval card still appear?

## Step 9: Concept 5, Custom tools with `createSdkMcpServer` + `tool()`

> A detailed, step-by-step account of how this concept was built is in [Tab5-Custom-tools.md](Tab5-Custom-tools.md).

**Server:** [server/concepts/05-custom-tools.ts](server/concepts/05-custom-tools.ts)

A custom tool is a function in the Node server with a zod schema. `tool()` defines it, `createSdkMcpServer()` groups
tools into an **in-process** MCP server, and `options.mcpServers` gives the servers to `query()`:

```ts
const tasks = createSdkMcpServer({
  name: "tasks",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: [
    tool("complete_task", "Mark a task as done, by id.", { id: z.number().int().positive() }, async ({ id }) => {
      if (!exists(id)) return { content: [{ type: "text", text: `No task with id ${id}.` }], isError: true };
      return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(task) }] };
    }),
  ],
});

query({ prompt, options: { mcpServers: { tasks, clock }, allowedTools: ["mcp__tasks"], strictMcpConfig: true } });
```

Two servers: `tasks` (`list_tasks`, `add_task`, `complete_task` on `sandbox/data/tasks.json`) and `clock` (`now`).
Every handler sends a `tool_handler` SSE event, so the UI shows when **your** code ran. `GET /api/c5/tools` returns each
tool's JSON Schema (`z.toJSONSchema`), which is what the model receives.

**Client:** [src/concepts/Concept05CustomTools.tsx](src/concepts/Concept05CustomTools.tsx)

| Piece | What it is | Where you see it |
|---|---|---|
| `tool(name, description, shape, handler)` | One function the model can call. `args` is typed from the zod shape | **Tool definitions** card |
| `createSdkMcpServer({ name, tools })` | An in-process MCP server: `{ type: "sdk", name, instance }` | `system/init` → `mcp_servers` (`"source": "sdk"`) |
| `options.mcpServers` | Which servers exist for this run | `system/init` → `tools`: `mcp__tasks__add_task`, … |
| `allowedTools: ["mcp__tasks"]` | Run a whole server's tools without asking (`mcp__tasks__add_task` for one) | The call succeeds instead of `permission_denials` |
| `CallToolResult` | `{ content: [{ type: "text", text }], isError? }` | **Tool calls** card, `tool_result` / `is_error` |

What to take away:

1. **The model sees `mcp__<server>__<tool>`**, and that is the name to use in `allowedTools`, `canUseTool` and hooks.
2. **zod runs before your code.** An invalid input (`title: "x"`) returns `MCP error -32602: Input validation error`
   to the model, and the handler never runs.
3. **`isError: true` is the tool's way to say "that failed, here is why".** The model reads the message and adapts.
4. **Custom tools need permission like built-in ones.** Without an allow rule the call is denied, even with
   `readOnlyHint: true`. And `allowedTools` never adds a tool: only `mcpServers` does.
5. **The permission check guards the call, not the handler.** `add_task` writes to disk with your server's rights,
   although the `Write` tool is not enabled.

### Check that it works

`npx tsc -p .` exits with 0, and all eight scenarios were run against the server:

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Something the model can't know | `mcp__clock__now` ran, the answer has the real time in Madrid |
| Allow one tool | 4 tools attached, only `list_tasks` allowed and used |
| Tools that change data | `add_task`, `complete_task`, `list_tasks`; `tasks.json` changed |
| Handler returns `isError` | *"No task with id 99. Existing ids: 1, 2, 3, 4."* |
| zod rejects the input | `Input validation error ... too_small`, no `tool_handler` event |
| Not in `allowedTools` | `permission_denials: [mcp__clock__now]` |
| Server not attached | `init.tools` has only the clock tool |
| Built-in + custom | `Read notes.txt`, then `add_task` for the TODO line |

## Things to try in Concept 5

1. Open **Tool definitions** and compare the `add_task` JSON Schema with its zod shape in the server file.
2. In scenario 5, change `.min(3)` to `.min(1)` in the server. Run it again: now the handler runs.
3. In scenario 2, ask "Add a task called Demo" instead. Which tool is denied, and what does the model say?
4. Remove `.describe(...)` from `now`'s `timeZone` and ask for "the time in Tokyo". Does the model still pass a valid zone?
5. Combine with Concept 4: in [server/concepts/05-custom-tools.ts](server/concepts/05-custom-tools.ts), add a
   `canUseTool` that allows `list_tasks` and denies `complete_task` with a message.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `esbuild` errors when running `vite` or `tsx` | `npm install-scripts approve esbuild && npm rebuild esbuild` |
| `EADDRINUSE :3001` or `:5173` | Another instance is still running. Stop it, or change the port in `server/index.ts` / `vite.config.ts` |
| Authentication error in the `result` message | Run `claude` once and log in, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` |
| `billing_error` / "Credit balance is too low" | The API key's Console account has no credits. Add credits, or comment out the key in `.env` to use the Claude Code login |
| `apiKeySource: "none"` although `.env` has a key | The server was started from inside a Claude Code session. Start it from a normal terminal |
| `[vite] http proxy error ... ECONNREFUSED` and no `Agent SDK server on ...` line | The server did not start. `tsx watch` hangs under `concurrently` on Windows, which is why `dev:server` uses `node --watch --import tsx` |
| The UI shows nothing after clicking Run | Check the `server` output in the terminal; errors are sent to the UI as an `error` event |
